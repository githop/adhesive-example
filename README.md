# adhesive-example

##Setup 

This is for getting the actual app. I used a yeoman generator to help get thing started. Rather than have you install the entire generator, you can simply clone this repository and serve the files locally see the app. The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/githop/adhesive-app)


###App Overview

Most of the application logic lives inside the [ThingService](https://github.com/githop/adhesive-app/blob/master/src/app/components/thingService/thing.service.js). 

I'm using angular-material pretty heavily in this app as well. It provides solution for both layout (using flex-box css) and simple directives. The toast notifcations, for example, were created with angular-material.
