# adhesive-example

##Setup 

This is for getting the actual app. I used a yeoman generator to help get thing started. Rather than have you install the entire generator, you can simply clone this repository and serve the files locally see the app. 


###App Overview

Most of the application logic lives inside the [ThingService](https://github.com/githop/adhesive-app/blob/master/src/app/components/thingService/thing.service.js).
